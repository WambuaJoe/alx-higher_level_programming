# 0x11. Python - Network #1

## Overview

The Python - Network #1 project explores various aspects of fetching internet resources and manipulating data from external services using Python. This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate fetching internet resources with the urllib and requests packages, making HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and other requests, decoding urllib body responses, fetching JSON resources, and manipulating data from external services.

## Resources

-   **HOWTO Fetch Internet Resources Using urllib Package**: A guide on fetching internet resources using the urllib package in Python.
-   **Quickstart with Requests package**: An introduction to using the requests package for making HTTP requests in Python.
-   **Requests package**: Documentation for the requests package, a simpler alternative to urllib for making HTTP requests.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, learners should be able to:

-   Explain how to fetch internet resources with the Python package urllib.
-   Decode urllib body responses to extract data.
-   Utilize the Python package requests for making HTTP requests, as it provides a simpler interface compared to urllib.
-   Make HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and other requests using requests.
-   Fetch JSON resources and manipulate data from external services.

## Copyright - Plagiarism

This project adheres to strict guidelines regarding plagiarism and copyright infringement. Solutions for the tasks must be original and meet the specified learning objectives. Publishing any content of this project is strictly prohibited.

## Requirements

-   **Allowed editors**: vi, vim, emacs
-   **Interpreter**: Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
-   **File Endings**: All files should end with a newline character.
-   **Shebang Line**: The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
-   **README.md**: A README.md file at the root of the repository containing a description of the repository is mandatory.
-   **Code Formatting**: Code should adhere to PEP8 standards using pycodestyle.
-   **File Execution**: Files should not execute when imported (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
-   **Error Handling**: Use `get` to access dictionary values by key to avoid exceptions.
-   **Documentation**: Modules should include documentation accessible via `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`.

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of Python's capabilities in handling network-related tasks, including fetching internet resources, making HTTP requests, and working with JSON data. Through practical examples and documentation, learners will gain proficiency in leveraging Python for networking tasks effectively.
