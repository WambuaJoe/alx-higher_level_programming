## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

-   **Why JavaScript programming is amazing:**
    
    -   JavaScript is versatile, used both on the client and server-side.
    -   It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it suitable for various tasks.
    -   Asynchronous programming with features like Promises and async/await allows for efficient handling of I/O operations.
-   **How to manipulate JSON data:**
    
    -   JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format.
    -   In JavaScript, JSON can be parsed from a string using `JSON.parse()` and converted to a string using `JSON.stringify()`.
    -   Objects and arrays can be easily manipulated using JSON methods.
-   **How to use request and fetch API:**
    
    -   The `request` module in Node.js is used to make HTTP requests.
    -   The `fetch` API is a modern alternative for making HTTP requests in browsers.
    -   Both `request` and `fetch` are used to fetch data from servers asynchronously.
-   **How to read and write a file using fs module:**
    
    -   The `fs` (file system) module in Node.js provides file system-related functions.
    -   `fs.readFile()` is used to read the content of a file asynchronously.
    -   `fs.writeFile()` is used to write data to a file asynchronously.

## Copyright - Plagiarism

-   You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks yourself to meet the learning objectives.
-   Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
-   You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.

## Requirements

-   **General:**
    -   Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    -   All files interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x)
    -   All files should end with a new line
    -   The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
    -   A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    -   Code should be semistandard compliant with semicolons on top
    -   All files must be executable
    -   The length of files will be tested using `wc`
    -   You are not allowed to use `var`

----------

By following these guidelines, you'll be able to effectively manipulate JSON data, make HTTP requests, and perform file operations in JavaScript, enhancing your skills for web scraping tasks.
